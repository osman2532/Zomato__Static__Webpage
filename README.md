# Zomato__Static__Webpage
I am excited to share my first full-fledged front-end web development project.
It was a challenging task that required a lot of time and effort, but it was worth it in the end.
Front-end development is an essential part of web development that focuses on creating the user interface and user experience of a website. 
I am satisfied with how my web page looks. 
It's always satisfying to see the results of your hard work. 
If you have any questions feel free to ask to contact me.
